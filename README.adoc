. http://gulpjs.com[Gulp] (command line interface only)

 $ npm install -g gulp-cli

For Asciidoctor::

 $ gem install bundler

=== Setup

Next, clone the repository and switch to the project directory:

 $ git clone -b asciidoc https://github.com/opendevise/presentation-bespoke-starter.git
   cd presentation-bespoke-starter

Then, install the required dependencies:

 $ bundle && npm i

NOTE: The `bundle` command is configured to install gems within this project, under the [.path]_rubygems/_ directory.
As normal, the `npm i` command installs Node.js modules into the [.path]_node_modules/_ directory.

Now you're all set to build the presentation!

You can build a static version of the slides using the following command:

 $ gulp

The files are built into the _public_ directory.
You can view the slides by navigating to _public/index.html_ in your browser.

=== Launching the preview server
